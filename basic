Based on the provided code and information, this project is focused on detecting and classifying traffic lights in images, not on detecting traffic itself. Here's a summary of what the project does:

Traffic Light Detection: The project uses a pre-trained object detection model (likely SSD MobileNet, though not shown in the provided code) to detect traffic lights in images.

Traffic Light Classification: After detecting traffic lights, the system uses a deep learning model based on the InceptionV3 architecture to classify the state of the traffic light.

Classification Categories: The model can classify traffic lights into 7 different states: go, goForward, goLeft, stop, stopLeft, warning, and warningLeft.

Image Processing: The system takes input images, resizes them to 224x224 pixels, and feeds them through the classification model.

Output: For a given input image containing a traffic light, the system predicts which of the 7 states the traffic light is displaying.

This project does not detect or analyze traffic flow. It's designed to recognize and classify the state of traffic lights in images, which could be a component of a larger traffic management or autonomous driving system, but it doesn't directly detect or manage traffic itself.
