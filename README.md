# Traffic Light Detection and Classification üö¶

This project utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for detecting and classifying traffic lights in images. The system combines object detection and image classification techniques to identify traffic lights and their states (Red, Green, Yellow). It can be used for autonomous driving systems or traffic monitoring applications.

## Overview üì∏

This project performs two main tasks:
1. **Traffic Light Detection**: Detect traffic lights in images using an SSD MobileNet pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Traffic Light Classification**: Classify the detected traffic light's state (Red, Green, Yellow) using transfer learning with an InceptionV3 model.

### Key Components
- **TLClassifier Class**: Loads the object detection model and performs traffic light detection on input images.
- **InceptionV3 Model**: Fine-tuned for classifying the state of the traffic light (Red, Green, Yellow).
- **Data Augmentation**: Used to increase dataset diversity and improve model generalization.

## Features üåü
- **Traffic Light Detection**: Identifies traffic lights in images using SSD MobileNet.
- **Traffic Light State Classification**: Classifies the state of traffic lights (Red, Green, Yellow) using transfer learning.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model robustness by using techniques like flipping, rotation, and zoom.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For model training and evaluation.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and visualization.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing performance metrics and confusion matrix.
- **SSD MobileNet**: Pre-trained object detection model for traffic light detection.
- **InceptionV3**: Pre-trained classification model for traffic light state recognition.

## Setup Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download Pre-trained Models
- SSD MobileNet for object detection (can be loaded from TensorFlow model hub).
- InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet (can be loaded directly from Keras).

## Usage üöó

### 1. Traffic Light Detection
- The **TLClassifier** class is responsible for loading the SSD MobileNet model and detecting traffic lights in input images. Use the following function to run detection:
   ```python
   tl_classifier.detect_traffic_lights(input_image)
   ```

### 2. Traffic Light Classification
- After detection, the system crops the region containing the traffic light and passes it to the **InceptionV3-based classifier** for classification. You can classify the traffic light state using:
   ```python
   tl_classifier.classify_traffic_light(cropped_image)
   ```

### 3. Example
   To run the full detection and classification on a test image:
   ```python
   from TLClassifier import TLClassifier

   tl_classifier = TLClassifier()

   # Step 1: Detect traffic light
   detected_traffic_lights = tl_classifier.detect_traffic_lights('test_image.jpg')

   # Step 2: Classify traffic light state
   for light in detected_traffic_lights:
       cropped_image = light['cropped_image']
       state = tl_classifier.classify_traffic_light(cropped_image)
       print(f"Traffic light state: {state}")
   ```

## Model Training üß†

The classification model is fine-tuned using a dataset of cropped traffic light images with various states. The model training involves the following steps:

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: The dataset consists of images of traffic lights with different states (red, green, yellow). These images are cropped from the input image.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Use InceptionV3 as a base model (pre-trained on ImageNet). The top layers are removed, and new dense layers are added for the classification task.
3. **Training**: The model is trained for 10 epochs with data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zoom to improve generalization.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a validation set, with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also generated.

### Training Command Example:
```python
python train_model.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.001
```

## Evaluation and Testing üß™

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to calculate the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among the predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positives among the actual positives.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the model's performance across different classes.

### Example Evaluation:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y_true = [...]  # True labels
y_pred = [...]  # Predicted labels

print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
plt.imshow(cm, cmap='Blues')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```
